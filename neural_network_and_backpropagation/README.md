# Feedforward Neural Network and Backpropagation
This is a simple Feedforward Neural Network(FNN), which is specifically a 3-layer feedforward network built from scratch using only Numpy library. The network has:
1. 2 Input neurons
2. 1 hidden layer with 3 neurons.
3. 3 output neurons.
In this, I have done forward pass and then backward pass for backpropagation. I have used the sigmoid activation function and trained the network using backpropagation to minimize the total error between predicted outputs and target values.
